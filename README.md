## Beta testing FigJenda
🗃 Download the ZIP file containing the codebase ![CleanShot 2021-11-29 at 18 27 02@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59372630/143958905-4dc3cf46-7b3e-4dc0-b74b-bcdd10dffa62.png)

🔍 Unzip the file wherever is convenient, but **you'll need to know where it is to load it into FigJam**

✨ Create a new FigJam file and right click anywhere on the canvas. Select `Import widget from manifest...` ![CleanShot 2021-11-29 at 18 38 09@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59372630/143959765-8c12c507-c144-4a02-9579-7eb35191f6fb.png)

🚀 You're ready to try FigJenda! Just right click on the canvas to add it from your widgets! 

⚡️ From here on out you can just copy paste it around to create as many agendas as you want! ![CleanShot 2021-11-29 at 18 53 24@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59372630/143961187-55ba1982-9223-4080-b2c0-50ebab6419e7.png)

#### Known bugs:
🐛 The numer inputs in the `Add`/`Edit` plugins are a UX nightmare and can feel pretty buggy. You can highlight and delete the number if things get ugly 😩

🪲 The widget doesn't know when FigJam's built-in timer is stopped so it will get stuck. Just press stop on the widget to reset it!!![CleanShot 2021-11-29 at 19 02 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59372630/143961944-27e3acdc-1522-40bc-a3bf-1f099b40c7ef.gif)

Code organization:

| dir / path           | description                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ui-src/              | This is where the iframe code lives  |
| ui-src/index.html    | Main entry point for the iframe code |
| widget-src/code.jsx  | This is the widget code              |
| dist/                | Built output goes here               |

- The iframe code uses a tool called [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle everything into a single html file


### importing your widget
1. "Import widget from manifest"
2. Build code `npm run build`
3. Choose your manifest

## iframe development

Often the code in the iframe can get pretty complex, if helpful, you can also do

```
npm run dev:ui
```

- This command starts a development server that will serve the iframe code at http://localhost:3000
- The development server will also hot reload any changes to your iframe code


## Scripts

| script                   | description                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| npm run build:watch      | watch-move build for both the widget and iframe code. Use this while in dev |
| npm run build            | one-off full build of both the iframe and widget                        |
| npm run build:main       | one-off build of the widget code                                        |
| npm run build:ui         | one-off build of the iframe code                                        |
